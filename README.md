# Resort Room Booking System
Section A: Program Specification
Design and develop room booking system for a resort. The main purpose of this system is to 
simulate room booking in a week for a small resort with two views (Jungle & Sea) with each view 
consist of 10 rooms. The charges per room is RM350.00 per night. The system will be used by 
resort staff.
The following characteristics are important to be included in your system:
 Staff 
 sign in to use the system
 book room for customer (Add)
- system allow staff to choose room based on day. Next the system will show 
all the available room(s) for the selected day. Now the staff can specify the 
room to book.
- Booking details such as customer name, IC/Passport, contact number, 
email, room id, days of stay etc should be included while booking.
 manage room booking details (Modify/Delete/Search/View).
 view receipt which consist details of customer, booked room and total charges 
including taxes.
- taxes imposed are service tax (10% of total room charges) plus tourism 
tax (RM10 per night)
Once the booking is done, the details should be stored in text file and the room(s) will be blocked 
for the selected day(s).
GUIs should be implemented for user interactions. The system should be running continuously 
unless an exit command is issued

The program submitted should compile and be executed without errors. Besides, validation should 
be done for each entry from the users in order to avoid logical errors.
